Tell me, Muse, of the man of many ways, who was driven
far journeys, after he had sacked Troy's sacred citadel.
Many were they whose cities he saw, whose minds he learned of, 
many the pains he suffered in his spirit on the wide sea,
struggling for his own life and the homecoming of his companions. 
Even so he could not save his companions, hard though
he stroke to; they were destroyed by their own wild recklessness, fools,
who devoured the oxen of Helios, the Sun God, and he took away the day
of their homecoming. From some point
here, goddess, daughter of Zeus, speak, and begin our story.
