From some point</p><p>here, goddess, daughter of Zeus, speak, and begin our story.</p><p> Then all the others, as many as fled sheer destruction,</p><p>were at home now, having escaped the sea and the fighting.</p><p>This one alone, longing for his wife and his homecoming,</p><p>was detained by the queenly nymph Kalypso, bright among goddesses,</p><p>in her hollowed caverns, desiring that he should be her husband.</p><p>But when in the circling of the years that very year came</p><p>in which the gods had spun for him his time of homecoming</p><p>to Ithaca, not even then was he free of his trials</p><p>nor among his own people. But all the gods pitied him</p><p>except Poseidon; he remained relentlessly angry</p><p>with godlike Odysseus, until his return to his own country.</p><p> But Poseidon was gone now to visit the far Aithiopians,</p><p>Aithiopians, most distant of men, who live divided,</p><p>some at the setting of Hyperion, some at his rising,</p><p>to receive a hecatomb of bulls and rams. There</p><p>he sat at the feast and took his pleasure. Meanwhile the other</p><p>Olympian gods were gathered together in the halls of Zeus.</p><p>First among them to speak was the father of gods and mortals,</p><p>for he was thinking in his heart of stately Aigisthos,</p><p>whom Orestes, Agamemnon’s far-famed son, had murdered.</p><p>Remembering him he spoke now before the immortals:</p><p> ‘Oh for shame, how the mortals put the blame upon us</p><p>gods, for they say evils come from us, but it is they, rather,</p><p>who by their own recklessness win sorrow beyond what is given,</p><p>as now lately, beyond what was given, Aigisthos married</p><p>the wife of Atreus’ son, and murdered him on his homecoming,</p><p>though he knew it was sheer destruction, for we ourselves had told him,</p><p>sending Hermes, the mighty watcher, Argeïphontes,</p><p>not to kill the man, nor court his lady for marriage;</p><p>for vengeance would come on him from Orestes, son of Atreides,</p><p>whenever he came of age and longed for his own country.</p><p>So Hermes told him, but for all his kind intention he could not</p><p>persuade the mind of Aigisthos. And now he has paid for everything.’</p></body></text></TEI>
